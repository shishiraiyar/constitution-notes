- **Ensure fair wages**: Mandate payment of minimum wages to workers.
- **Promote welfare**: Provide facilities like clean water, sanitation, and first aid.
- **Reduce industrial tensions**: Create a harmonious work environment.

### Key Provisions of the Factories Act, 1948

#### Working Hours and Overtime

- **Maximum working hours**: 48 hours per week and 9 hours per day.
- **Overtime**: Overtime work should not exceed 9 hours in a day.
- **Weekly holiday**: Workers are entitled to one day off per week.

#### Minimum Wages

- Employers must pay workers at least the prescribed minimum wage.

- **First aid**: Factories must have first aid boxes and records.
- **Medical facilities**: Arrangements must be made for transporting injured workers to hospitals.

#### Child Labour and Welfare

### Recent Amendments and Labour Codes

The Factories Act, 1948, has been amended several times to adapt to changing industrial scenarios. Recently, the Indian government consolidated various labour laws into four Labour Codes:

- **Code on Wages, 2019**
- **Industrial Relations Code, 2020**
- **Occupational Safety, Health, and Working Conditions Code, 2020**
- **Code on Social Security, 2020**

These codes aim to simplify and modernize labour laws, but their implementation is still pending.

### Analysis of Labour Codes

- **Consolidation**: The Labour Codes consolidate 29 existing labour laws into four codes.
- **Challenges**: Many provisions from older laws have been replicated without significant improvements.
- **Unorganized Sector**: The codes fail to adequately address the needs of workers in the unorganized sector.
- **IT Sector**: The applicability of labour laws to the IT sector remains ambiguous, leaving IT employees vulnerable to issues like mass layoffs (pink slips).
