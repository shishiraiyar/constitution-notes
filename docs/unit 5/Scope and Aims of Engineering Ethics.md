## Responsibility in Engineering

### Moral Accountability

Engineers are held to high ethical standards, ensuring honesty, fairness, and dedication to public safety. Responsibility can apply to individuals, teams, or organizations and may involve legal, job-defined, or moral accountability.

### Engineering Standards

Engineering codes of ethics require compliance with regulatory and technical standards to ensure safety and quality. These standards dictate design requirements and verification procedures.

### Types of Responsibility

1. **Obligation Responsibility** – A forward-looking duty to oversee projects and ensure ethical and technical standards are met.
2. **Blame Responsibility** – A backward-looking concept where individuals are held accountable for errors or accidents.

### Standard of Care

Engineers must not only follow standard procedures but also exercise sound judgment in unforeseen situations. They are liable only when their errors exceed the acceptable level defined by professional norms.

### Case Study: Kansas City Hyatt Regency Collapse (1981)

Engineers were held responsible for negligence as proper oversight could have prevented the fatal walkway collapse. This highlights the importance of meeting the standard of care.

### Blame-Responsibility & Causation

Accidents can be analyzed through:

- **Physical causes** (mechanical failure)
- **Organizational causes** (poor processes)
- **Individual accountability** (negligence or oversight)

Corporations can also bear moral responsibility as they have decision-making mechanisms, policies, and distinct interests.

### Liability in Engineering

Engineers can be held liable if they:

1. **Intentionally** cause harm.
2. **Recklessly** act despite knowing harm is likely.
3. **Negligently** cause harm through avoidable mistakes.

### Design Standards

Engineers must adapt safety standards to varying contexts while ensuring quality and safety. As technology evolves, standards may require updates.

### Global Engineering Standards

Engineering standards increasingly transcend national boundaries due to global concerns over quality, safety, and sustainability.

### The Problem of Many Hands

In large organizations, individuals often evade responsibility by arguing that too many people were involved in an incident. However, collective inaction still results in shared accountability.

## Impediments to Responsible Action in Engineering

### Self-Interest

Engineers have personal ambitions and desires beyond their professional responsibilities. When self-interest is taken to an extreme, it turns into **egoism**—prioritizing personal gain over ethical responsibilities, potentially harming others.

**Example:** An engineer may cut costs to increase company profits while compromising safety standards.

### Self-Deception

Engineers may justify unethical actions by convincing themselves they are doing nothing wrong. This intentional avoidance of truth allows individuals to act irresponsibly while maintaining a clear conscience.

**Common Justifications:**

- "I’m not doing this just for myself."
- "Everyone takes shortcuts occasionally."

**Example:** Ignoring a minor flaw in a design by believing it is not significant, even when safety is at risk.

### Fear

Fear of consequences—such as losing a job, demotion, or facing punishment—can prevent engineers from acting responsibly. **Whistleblowers**, who expose unethical practices, often face serious retaliation, making it harder for individuals to speak out.

**Example:** An engineer noticing a safety flaw in a product but staying silent due to fear of job loss.

### Ignorance

Lack of critical information can lead to unintentional errors. Engineers cannot act responsibly if they are unaware of potential risks. Sometimes, **organizational culture** itself can create barriers to knowledge sharing.

**Example:** In the **Columbia Space Shuttle disaster**, engineers and managers had poor communication, leading to fatal decisions based on incomplete information.

### Egocentric Tendencies

Engineers, like all people, naturally see the world from their own perspective. Without effort, they may fail to consider other viewpoints, leading to biased or incomplete decision-making.

**Example:** An engineer designing an AI system may focus solely on technical efficiency while ignoring ethical concerns, such as bias in decision-making.

### Microscopic Vision

Engineers often focus deeply on technical details but may fail to consider the broader impact of their work. While their calculations and designs may be accurate, they might overlook ethical, social, or environmental implications.

**Example:** A software engineer developing facial recognition technology may focus on performance while neglecting concerns about privacy or misuse.

### Groupthink

When engineers work in groups, they may conform to the group’s decisions rather than critically evaluating them. The pressure to **be a team player** can lead to poor decision-making, as dissenting opinions are suppressed.

**How to Minimize Groupthink:**

- Leaders should **encourage diverse viewpoints** and avoid pressuring the group toward consensus.
- Engineers should be trained to **think critically** and challenge assumptions.

**Example:** In the **Challenger Space Shuttle disaster**, engineers hesitated to speak up about O-ring failures due to group pressure and management decisions.

## Risks, Safety and Liability in Engineering

### Risk as the Product of Probability and Magnitude of Harm

Risk is typically defined as the combination of:

- **The likelihood of harm occurring** (probability)
- **The severity of the harm** (magnitude)

Engineers assess risk by analyzing how probable an adverse event is and the extent of its impact. For example, if a bridge collapses, the impact could include loss of lives and economic damage. These aspects can be quantified in terms of cost, fatalities, and structural damage.

### Utilitarianism & Acceptable Risks

In engineering, **acceptable risk** is often evaluated using a **cost-benefit analysis**, which compares the probability and magnitude of harm with the probability and magnitude of benefit.

An **acceptable risk** is defined as:
*"A risk where the product of probability and magnitude of harm is balanced or outweighed by the product of probability and magnitude of benefit, and no better alternative exists."*

#### Limitations of Cost-Benefit Analysis:

1. **Uncertainty in Predictions** – Engineers cannot always predict all possible risks and benefits accurately.
2. **Difficulty in Quantifying Values** – Not all factors (e.g., loss of life, environmental damage) can be converted into monetary terms.
3. **Fairness in Distribution** – It does not consider **who** bears the risks versus **who** enjoys the benefits.
4. **Lack of Public Consent** – Cost-benefit analysis does not involve public input, which can lead to ethical concerns.

### Expanding the Engineering Account of Risk: The Capabilities Approach

The **Capabilities Approach** provides a broader way to evaluate risk by focusing on how disasters affect people’s overall well-being. Instead of just looking at economic losses and fatalities, it considers how risk impacts people's ability to live the kind of life they value.

A risk is acceptable if:

- The probability of harm is **low enough** that it does not fall below a minimum acceptable threshold of well-being.

For example, a flood protection system should not just be evaluated based on cost savings but also on how well it preserves people's **access to clean water, homes, and essential services**.

### Risk Communication & Public Policy

**Engineers, governments, and companies** assess risk using technical calculations, but the **general public** often perceives risk based on past events, emotions, and intuitive judgments.

Thus, public policy should consider more than just engineering risk assessments. Engineers must adapt their communication strategies to align with public concerns and expectations.

#### Guidelines for Engineers in Risk Communication:

1. **Differentiate Between Risk and Risky Situations** – Explain that risk involves both probability and magnitude, not just one factor.
2. **Avoid Misleading Statements About “Zero Risk”** – The public interprets "zero risk" differently than engineers. Instead of saying "there's no such thing as zero risk," clarify that familiar risks may seem lower even if they are not.
3. **Acknowledge Limitations in Risk Predictions** – Engineers should admit uncertainties in their risk assessments rather than overpromising accuracy.
4. **Consider Both Cost-Benefit and Government Obligations** – Ethical considerations must complement cost-benefit analyses.
5. **Present Information Objectively** – Especially in controversial areas like nuclear energy, professional societies should ensure that risk data is presented without bias.

### Challenges in Determining the Causes & Likelihood of Harm

#### The Critical Attitude Toward Accuracy

- The public expects **precise estimates** of risk, but engineers often work with approximations.
- Experts may not always be able to provide exact probabilities of failures.

#### Failure Analysis Techniques

To better understand and predict failures, engineers use analytical methods such as:

- **Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)** – A **deductive** method that starts with an **undesirable event** (e.g., a bridge collapse) and traces backward to find potential causes.
- **Event Tree Analysis (ETA)** – An **inductive** method that starts with a **single failure** (e.g., a faulty circuit) and examines how it could lead to broader system failures.

Both methods help engineers anticipate failure modes and improve safety.
